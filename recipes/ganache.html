        Description
    </h2>
    <p>
    Chocolate ganache — made from just chocolate and cream — is a glaze, frosting, filling, or sauce. Ganache was reportedly created in 1869 by Parisian playwright and confectioner Paul Siraudin, who is said to have named it after a popular Vaudevillian comedy called Les Ganaches.
